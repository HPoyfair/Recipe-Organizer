# Recipe Organizer

## Description

The **Recipe Organizer** is a web application designed to help users manage their recipes conveniently. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and search for recipes by name or ingredients. It also includes functionality to load predefined recipes and store user-created recipes locally for persistence.

- Quickly search for recipes by name or ingredients.
- Edit existing recipes to accommodate new variations.
- Save and load recipes persistently across sessions.

### Learnings
This project provided insights into:
- Managing local storage for data persistence.
- Handling DOM manipulations for dynamic user interfaces.
- Efficient search and filter algorithms.
- Event-driven programming in JavaScript.
