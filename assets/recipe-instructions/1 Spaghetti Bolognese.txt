Spaghetti Bolognese
Ingredients:

Spaghetti
Tomato sauce
Ground beef
Instructions:

Boil a pot of water, add a pinch of salt, and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until browned and fully cooked. Break it up with a spoon as it cooks.
Once the beef is cooked, add the tomato sauce to the skillet and stir well. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
Combine the cooked spaghetti with the sauce in the skillet, tossing to coat the pasta evenly.
Serve hot, optionally garnishing with grated cheese or fresh basil.
